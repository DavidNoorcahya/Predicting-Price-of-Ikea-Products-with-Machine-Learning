# Predicting-Price-of-Ikea-Products-with-Machine-Learning

Data science is a science that is quite complex, comprehensive but very interesting to learn. Moreover, the implementation of data science is very useful as human needs and technology develop. While machine learning quoted from wikipedia is a branch of artificial intelligence, which is a discipline that includes the design and development of algorithms that allow computers to develop behavior based on empirical data, such as from sensor data databases.

This time I created a project that aims to predict product prices from IKEA based on certain specifications of the product using machine learning. In this project, I used IKEA product data obtained by web scraping on the IKEA website (https://www.ikea.com/sa/en/cat/furniture-fu001/), which I then took from the website. Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedkallam/ikea-sa-furniture-web-scraping).
